** Note:  This is my very first attempt at a VB program **

As an online gamer with a home network behind an Internet router,
I at times really wished for a utility that would allow me to
determine what my *actual* INTERNET IP address is, to allow me to
easily host games for friends.

I found quite a few VB based utils that would allow me to get 
my *Local* IP address,but none that would get my *Internet* IP address.

So, I sat down with VB6, and coded TrueIP in about an hour.  VB Vets
might laugh, but I was literally flying blind here.  LOL

The proggy works by parsing the HTML from www.whatismyip.com, and
displays just the IP address in a small window, and using the winsock ocx
for the local IP.  Short, sweet, and to the point.

If anyone enhances my virginal (LOL) attempt at coding, please share!

Thx.

AIR.
